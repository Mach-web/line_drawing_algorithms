# line_drawing_algorithms
- This repository implements line drawing algorithms such as slope intercept, DDA and Bresenham algorithms.
- The repository is organized in such a way that a class holds the various methods that are used to implement the drawing algorithms.
- The last method i.e drawing. Draws a grid to visualize implementation of each of the algorithms.
- The drawing method is called after each implementation of an algorithm.
- To test the algorithms, various objects are initialised and the subsequent methods called.
